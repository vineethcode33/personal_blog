            <strong> What is a Linked List?</strong>
            <br />
            <i>
              A linked list is a linear data structure that contains a
              <mark>sequence of nodes</mark>, in which each node contains data
              and a pointer to another node.</i
            >
            The most common example is a singly linked list, where each node
            contains a piece of data and a pointer to the next list, as shown in
            the diagram below.

              Advantages of Linked Lists:
            </strong>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            When I first encountered linked lists, I struggled to see their
            benefits. The thought of having to traverse the entire list to
            access an element seemed time-consuming, and I wondered what upside
            linked lists had to offer. What I hadnâ€™t yet considered is the
            benefits linked lists offer when it comes to memory and storage.
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Arrays are static in size, meaning the upper limit in terms of
            number of items has to be known in advance when creating the memory
            to store an array. This can often lead to extra memory that is not
            used because the upper limit is never reached, or, having to create
            a new object in memory if the upper limit is exceeded. This is less
            of an issue now because most modern programming languages have
            operations running under the hood that can efficiently shrink and
            grow arrays, but it remains a critical feature when it comes to
            understanding linked lists. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The other case where linked lists are very useful is random
            insertion of a new data point. If for example, you have an array [1,
            3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and you want to insert the value 2 between 1 and 3,
            you would to have shift every value from 3 to 7 over a space so that
            2 could be stored in the second position. This makes random
            insertion an expensive operation in terms of an memory when it comes
            to arrays. In a linked list, however, you could simply create a new
            node with the value data: 2 that points to the node with the value
            of 3 next, and update the next value of the first node to point to
            our new node instead of the one with the value of 3. This is a much
            cheaper operation than what we have to do with an array in this
            scenario.
