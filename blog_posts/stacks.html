            <strong> What is a Stack?</strong>
            <br />
            <i>
              A stack is a list of items that can only be
              <mark> changed from one side</mark>, called the top of the stack.
            </i>
            <br />
            Plate dispensers are a great real-world analogy to stacks. Plates
            can only be added or removed from the top of the stack. The last
            plate you add is the always the first plate you take out. This is
            referred to as the
            <strong> Last-In-First-Out principle (LIFO).</strong>
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="../images/stacks.png" alt="Stacks" />
          </figure>
          <p>
            Stacks only allow us to push() items to the top of the stack, and
            pop() the item that was just added. “But what happens if you never
            Undo? The stack must become huge!” Correct. Since you can never
            remove anything from a Stack except the last action, the Undo Stack
            will eventually become huge. This is why applications like Adobe
            Photoshop start using a large amount of RAM the longer you work on a
            file. The Undo Stack stores all of your actions in memory until you
            save and exit the file.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            You can implement a Stack using a LinkedList or a Array:
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Arrays use a contiguous block of memory, so they will take up
            unnecessary space when the Stack is small. Another downside is that
            Arrays have to copy themselves to a new memory location every time
            they reach their pre-allocated capacity.
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            LinkedLists do not use contiguous memory. Linked Lists never have to
            make a copy of themselves; they can grow indefinitely. So using them
            is slightly more optimal from a time complexity perspective.
            However, LinkedLists require each item to know the memory address of
            the next item in the list, so they take a bit of extra space.
